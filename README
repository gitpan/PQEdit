PQEdit is a perl cgi script which provides general purpose Web-based database
table editing for relational database tables using automatic CGI forms.  PQEdit
is based on the RDBAL Relational Database Abstraction Layer Schema Object.
Currently it supports Oracle (via ODBC) and all Transact-SQL relational
database servers.  This has been tested, at least minimally, on the Apache web
server under Solaris and MS WinNT and on MS IIS 3.0 under MS WinNT.

It runs on a web server as a Perl 5 CGI script that uses the CGI,
Apache::Sybase::DBlib, Sybase::DBlib, Win32::ODBC, RDBAL, RDBAL::Schema
modules.

PQ Edit uses the RDBAL::Schema module to query the database for information
about the tables and fields available.  Based on this information, it tries
construct a reasonable interface for editing any table of interest.

PQ Edit does not maintain a connection to the database--it reconnects to the
database server on each action.  PQ Edit passes the username and password
given to it to itself on each action so that it can reconnect to the database
server.

INSTALLATION: 

To install this package, just change to the directory in which this file is
found and type the following: 

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

And then copy pqedit.cgi to a place in your web directory tree that allows CGI
scripts to run (if your web server supports mod_perl, a mod_perl location is
preferred). pqedit.cgi will be copied to your '/usr/local/bin' directory also. 

The mssql_pqweb.sql or sybase_pqweb.sql DDL scripts may be used to create the
appropriate tables in the optional pqweb database.  See the comments at the top
of these files for their usage.
